## About the Project

GADA is a mobile application that aims to modernize the way funding is provided for specific issues in our country. Currently, this is done through ethio telecom using text messages like 8100. Our plan is to develop a mobile application where everything is direct and easy.

The application will have three types of users:

- Administrators: Have full privileges to all CRUD capabilities towards all features like adding/removing clients, donations, and posts. They will have a managing page which includes authentication and authorization.
- Clients: Have privileges to CRUD posts, login into their accounts, have their own profiles, and can manage them.
- Users: Can only see the posts and provide donations. They will have their own profile pages and can manage them.

## Features

- Posts: Specific issues that need funding.
- Donations: Where a user can provide funds.
- Authentication and Authorization Features: The admin will be authorized for all CRUD capabilities of both features. The client will have authorization for CRUD capabilities of their own posts. Users will only be authorized to creating, reading donations. Both clients and users will be able to create, update, read, and delete their own profiles. Authentication will be added so that no one will be able to access what they aren't authorized to do, and authentication will also be added when logging in.
