The general idea of "GADA"which means gift is to create a web application where some users can post a specific issues related to funding and other users can lend a helping hand. currently In our country this is done through ethio telecom using text messages like 8100. And our plan is to modernize this way by developing a mobile application where every thing is direct and easy.

For this project we will have 3 type of users;

1. Administrators
      1. that have full previlages to all CRUD cpabilities towards all feature like adding/removing clients, donations and posts
      2. will have managing page which includes authentication and authorization
2. clients
      1  have privillages to CRUD posts
      2. login into their accounts
      3. have their own profiles and can manage it
3. users
      1. login(sign up if first time)
      2. can only see the posts and provide donations
      3. will have their own profile pages and can manage it

BUSINESS FEATURES 
1. Posts: specific issues that needs funding
2. Donations: where a user can provide funds


Authentication and Authorization Features

1. The admin will be authorized for all CRUD capabilities of both features
2. The client will have authorization for CRUD capabilities of their own posts
3. Users will only be authorized to creating,Reading donations
4. Both clients and users will be able to create, update, read and delete their own profiles

5. Authentication will be added so that that no one will be able to access what he/she isn't authorized to do so
